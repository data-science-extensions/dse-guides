    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Working as a Data Scientist or Data Engineer often involves querying data from various sources. There are many tools and libraries available to perform these tasks, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Also, there are many different ways to achieve similar results, depending on the tool or library used. It's important to be familiar with these different methods to choose the best one for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to query data using different tools and libraries, including Pandas, SQL, PySpark, and Polars. Each section will cover the setup, data creation, and various querying techniques such as filtering, grouping, joining, window functions, ranking, and sorting. The output will be identical across all tools, but the transformations will be implemented using the specific syntax and features of each library. Therefore allowing you to compare the different approaches and understand the nuances of each method."

    "## Overview of the Different Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the querying techniques, let's take a moment to understand the different libraries and tools we will be using in this article. Each library has its own strengths and weaknesses, and understanding these can help you choose the right tool for your specific use case.\n",

    "### SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "[SQL][sql-wiki] (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is widely used for querying and modifying data in databases. SQL is a declarative language, meaning that you specify what you want to retrieve or manipulate without detailing how to do it. This makes SQL queries concise and expressive. SQL is particularly well-suited for working with large datasets and complex queries. It provides powerful features for filtering, grouping, joining, and aggregating data. SQL is the backbone of many database systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is actually a language (like Python is a language), not a library (like Pandas is a library), and it is used to interact with relational databases. The core of the SQL language is actually an [ISO standard][sql-iso], which means that the basic syntax and functionality are consistent across different database systems. However, each database system may have its own extensions or variations of SQL, which can lead to differences in syntax and features. Each database system can be considered as variations (or dialects) of SQL, with their own specific features and optimizations and syntax enhancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the more popular SQL dialects include:\n",

    "Next, we will calculate the rolling average of sales over a 7-day window. Rolling averages (aka moving averages) are useful for smoothing out short-term fluctuations and highlighting longer-term trends in the data. This is particularly useful in time series analysis, where we want to understand the underlying trend in the data without being overly influenced by short-term variations. It is also a very common technique used in financial analysis to analyze stock prices, sales data, and other time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, we can calculate the 7-day moving average of sales using the `AVG()` window function with the `OVER` clause. It is important to include this `OVER` clause, because it is what the SQL engine uses to determine that it should be a Window function, rather than a regular aggregate function (which is specified using the `GROUP BY` clause).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here in our example, there are three different parts to the Window function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The `ORDER BY` clause**: This specifies the order of the rows in the window. In this case, we are ordering by the `sale_date` column.\n",
    "2. **The `ROWS BETWEEN` clause**: This specifies the range of rows to include in the window. In this case, we are including the number of rows from 6 preceding rows to the current row. This means that for each row, the window will include the current row and the 6 rows before it, giving us a total of 7 rows in the window. It is important that you specify the `ORDER BY` clause before the `ROWS BETWEEN` clause to ensure that the correct rows are included in the window.\n",
    "3. **The `AVG()` function**: This calculates the average of the `total_sales` column over the specified window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another peculiarity to note here is around the use of the sub-query. The sub-query is used to first calculate the daily sales, including the previous and next day sales, and the day-over-day change. This is because we need to calculate the moving average over the daily sales, rather than the individual sales transactions. The sub-query allows us to aggregate the sales data by date before calculating the moving average. The only change that we are including in the outer-query is the addition of the moving average calculation."
