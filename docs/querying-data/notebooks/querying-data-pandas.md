## Introduction

Working as a Data Scientist or Data Engineer often involves querying data from various sources. There are many tools and libraries available to perform these tasks, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Also, there are many different ways to achieve similar results, depending on the tool or library used. It's important to be familiar with these different methods to choose the best one for your specific use case.

This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to query data using different tools and libraries, including Pandas, SQL, PySpark, and Polars. Each section will cover the setup, data creation, and various querying techniques such as filtering, grouping, joining, window functions, ranking, and sorting. The output will be identical across all tools, but the transformations will be implemented using the specific syntax and features of each library. Therefore allowing you to compare the different approaches and understand the nuances of each method.


## Overview of the Different Libraries

Before we dive into the querying techniques, let's take a moment to understand the different libraries and tools we will be using in this article. Each library has its own strengths and weaknesses, and understanding these can help you choose the right tool for your specific use case.

Throughout this article, you can easily switch between the different libraries by selecting the appropriate tab. Each section will provide the same functionality, but implemented using the specific syntax and features of each library.

=== "Pandas"

    [Pandas] is a powerful data manipulation library in Python that provides data structures and functions for working with structured data. It is widely used for data analysis and manipulation tasks.

    Historically, Pandas was one of the first libraries to provide a DataFrame structure, which is similar to a table in a relational database. It allows for easy data manipulation, filtering, grouping, and aggregation. Pandas is built on top of [NumPy][numpy] and provides a high-level interface for working with data. It is particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized datasets and is often used in Data Science and Machine Learning workflows.

    Pandas provides a rich set of functionalities for data manipulation, including filtering, grouping, joining, and window functions. It also integrates well with other libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, making it a popular choice among data scientists and analysts.

    While Pandas is both powerful and popular, it is important to note that it operates **in-memory**, which means that it may not be suitable for very large datasets that do not fit into memory. In such cases, other libraries like PySpark or Polars may be more appropriate.

## Setup

Before we start querying data, we need to set up our environment. This includes importing the necessary libraries, creating sample data, and defining constants that will be used throughout the article. The following sections will guide you through this setup process. The code for this article is also available on GitHub: [querying-data][querying-data].

=== "Pandas"

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Setup"}
    # StdLib Imports
    from typing import Any

    # Third Party Imports
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from plotly import express as px, graph_objects as go, io as pio


    # Set seed for reproducibility
    np.random.seed(42)

    # Determine the number of records to generate
    n_records = 100

    # Set default Plotly template
    pio.templates.default = "simple_white+gridon"

    # Set Pandas display options
    pd.set_option("display.max_columns", None)
    ```

Once the setup is complete, we can proceed to create our sample data. This data will be used for querying and will be consistent across all libraries. All tables will be created from scratch with randomly generated data to simulate a real-world scenario. This is to ensure that the examples are self-contained and can be run without any external dependencies, and also there is no issues about data privacy or security.

For the below data creation steps, we will be defining the tables using Python dictionaries. Each dictionary will represent a table, with keys as column names and values as lists of data. We will then convert these dictionaries into DataFrames or equivalent structures in each library.

First, we will create a sales fact table. This table will contain information about sales transactions, including the date, customer ID, product ID, category, sales amount, and quantity sold.

```py {.python linenums="1" title="Create Sales Fact Data"}
sales_data: dict[str, Any] = {
    "date": pd.date_range(start="2023-01-01", periods=n_records, freq="D"),
    "customer_id": np.random.randint(1, 100, n_records),
    "product_id": np.random.randint(1, 50, n_records),
    "category": np.random.choice(["Electronics", "Clothing", "Food", "Books", "Home"], n_records),
    "sales_amount": np.random.uniform(10, 1000, n_records).round(2),
    "quantity": np.random.randint(1, 10, n_records),
}
```

Next, we will create a product dimension table. This table will contain information about products, including the product ID, name, price, category, and supplier ID.

```py {.python linenums="1" title="Create Product Dimension Data"}
product_data: dict[str, Any] = {
    "product_id": np.arange(1, 51),
    "product_name": [f"Product {i}" for i in range(1, 51)],
    "price": np.random.uniform(10, 500, 50).round(2),
    "category": np.random.choice(["Electronics", "Clothing", "Food", "Books", "Home"], 50),
    "supplier_id": np.random.randint(1, 10, 50),
}
```

Finally, we will create a customer dimension table. This table will contain information about customers, including the customer ID, name, city, state, and segment.

```py {.python linenums="1" title="Create Customer Dimension Data"}
customer_data: dict[str, Any] = {
    "customer_id": np.arange(1, 101),
    "customer_name": [f"Customer {i}" for i in range(1, 101)],
    "city": np.random.choice(["New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago", "Houston", "Phoenix"], 100),
    "state": np.random.choice(["NY", "CA", "IL", "TX", "AZ"], 100),
    "segment": np.random.choice(["Consumer", "Corporate", "Home Office"], 100),
}
```

Now that we have our sample data created, we can proceed to the querying section. Each of the following sections will demonstrate how to perform similar operations using the different libraries and methods, allowing you to compare and contrast their capabilities.


## Create the DataFrames

=== "Pandas"

    To create the dataframes in Pandas, we will use the data we generated earlier. We will parse the dictionaries into Pandas DataFrames, which will allow us to perform various data manipulation tasks.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Create DataFrames"}
    df_sales_pd: pd.DataFrame = pd.DataFrame(sales_data)
    df_product_pd: pd.DataFrame = pd.DataFrame(product_data)
    df_customer_pd: pd.DataFrame = pd.DataFrame(customer_data)
    ```

    Once the data is created, we can check that it has been loaded correctly by displaying the first few rows of each DataFrame. To do this, we will use the [`.head()`][pandas-head] method to display the first 5 rows of each DataFrame, and then parse to the [`print()`][python-print] function to display the DataFrame in a readable format.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Check Sales DataFrame"}
    print(f"Sales DataFrame: {len(df_sales_pd)}")
    print(df_sales_pd.head(5))
    print(df_sales_pd.head(5).to_markdown())
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ```txt
    Sales DataFrame: 100
    ```

    ```txt
            date  customer_id  product_id     category  sales_amount  quantity
    0 2023-01-01           52          45         Food        490.76         7
    1 2023-01-02           93          41  Electronics        453.94         5
    2 2023-01-03           15          29         Home        994.51         5
    3 2023-01-04           72          15  Electronics        184.17         7
    4 2023-01-05           61          45         Food         27.89         9
    ```

    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    </div>

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Check Customer DataFrame"}

    </div>

## 1. Filtering and Selecting

This first section will demonstrate how to filter and select data from the DataFrames. This is a common operation in data analysis, allowing us to focus on specific subsets of the data.

=== "Pandas"

    In Pandas, we can use boolean indexing to filter rows based on specific conditions. As you can see in this first example, this looks like using square brackets, within which we define a column and a condition. In the below example, we can use string values to filter categorical data.

    For more information about filtering in Pandas, see the [Pandas documentation on filtering][pandas-subsetting].

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Filter sales data for specific category"}
    electronics_sales_pd: pd.DataFrame = df_sales_pd[df_sales_pd["category"] == "Electronics"]
    print(f"Number of Electronics Sales: {len(electronics_sales_pd)}")
    print(electronics_sales_pd.head(5))
    print(electronics_sales_pd.head(5).to_markdown())
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ```txt
    Number of Electronics Sales: 28
    ```

    ```txt
             date  customer_id  product_id     category  sales_amount  quantity
    1  2023-01-02           93          41  Electronics        453.94         5
    3  2023-01-04           72          15  Electronics        184.17         7
    8  2023-01-09           75           9  Electronics        746.73         2
    10 2023-01-11           88           1  Electronics        314.98         9
    11 2023-01-12           24          44  Electronics        547.11         8
    ```

    |      | date                | customer_id | product_id | category    | sales_amount | quantity |
    | ---: | :------------------ | ----------: | ---------: | :---------- | -----------: | -------: |
    |    1 | 2023-01-02 00:00:00 |          93 |         41 | Electronics |       453.94 |        5 |
    |    3 | 2023-01-04 00:00:00 |          72 |         15 | Electronics |       184.17 |        7 |
    |    8 | 2023-01-09 00:00:00 |          75 |          9 | Electronics |       746.73 |        2 |
    |   10 | 2023-01-11 00:00:00 |          88 |          1 | Electronics |       314.98 |        9 |
    |   11 | 2023-01-12 00:00:00 |          24 |         44 | Electronics |       547.11 |        8 |

    </div>

We can also use numerical filtering, as you can see in the next example, where we filter for sales amounts greater than $500.

=== "Pandas"

    When it comes to numerical filtering in Pandas, the process is similar to the previous example, where we use boolean indexing to filter rows based on a given condition condition, but here we use a numerical value instead of a string value. In the below example, we filter for sales amounts greater than `500`.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Filter for high value transactions"}
    high_value_sales_pd: pd.DataFrame = df_sales_pd[df_sales_pd["sales_amount"] > 500]
    print(f"Number of high-value Sales: {len(high_value_sales_pd)}")
    print(high_value_sales_pd.head(5))
    print(high_value_sales_pd.head(5).to_markdown())
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ```txt
    Number of high-value Sales: 43
    ```

    ```txt
             date  customer_id  product_id     category  sales_amount  quantity
    2  2023-01-03           15          29         Home        994.51         5
    8  2023-01-09           75           9  Electronics        746.73         2
    9  2023-01-10           75          24        Books        723.73         6
    11 2023-01-12           24          44  Electronics        547.11         8
    12 2023-01-13            3           8     Clothing        513.73         5
    ```

    |      | date                | customer_id | product_id | category    | sales_amount | quantity |
    | ---: | :------------------ | ----------: | ---------: | :---------- | -----------: | -------: |
    |    2 | 2023-01-03 00:00:00 |          15 |         29 | Home        |       994.51 |        5 |
    |    8 | 2023-01-09 00:00:00 |          75 |          9 | Electronics |       746.73 |        2 |
    |    9 | 2023-01-10 00:00:00 |          75 |         24 | Books       |       723.73 |        6 |
    |   11 | 2023-01-12 00:00:00 |          24 |         44 | Electronics |       547.11 |        8 |
    |   12 | 2023-01-13 00:00:00 |           3 |          8 | Clothing    |       513.73 |        5 |

    </div>

In addition to subsetting a table by rows (aka _filtering_), we can also subset a table by columns (aka _selecting_). This allows us to create a new DataFrame with only the relevant columns we want to work with. This is useful when we want to focus on specific attributes of the data, such as dates, categories, or sales amounts.


=== "Pandas"

    To select specific columns in Pandas, we can use the double square brackets syntax to specify the columns we want to keep in the DataFrame. This allows us to create a new DataFrame with only the relevant columns.

    For more information about selecting specific columns, see the [Pandas documentation on selecting columns][pandas-subsetting].

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Select specific columns"}
    sales_summary_pd: pd.DataFrame = df_sales_pd[["date", "category", "sales_amount"]]
    print(f"Sales Summary DataFrame: {len(sales_summary_pd)}")
    print(sales_summary_pd.head(5))
    print(sales_summary_pd.head(5).to_markdown())
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ```txt
    Sales Summary DataFrame: 100
    ```

    ```txt
            date     category  sales_amount
    0 2023-01-01         Food        490.76
    1 2023-01-02  Electronics        453.94
    2 2023-01-03         Home        994.51
    3 2023-01-04  Electronics        184.17
    4 2023-01-05         Food         27.89
    ```

    |      | date                | category    | sales_amount |
    | ---: | :------------------ | :---------- | -----------: |
    |    0 | 2023-01-01 00:00:00 | Food        |       490.76 |
    |    1 | 2023-01-02 00:00:00 | Electronics |       453.94 |
    |    2 | 2023-01-03 00:00:00 | Home        |       994.51 |
    |    3 | 2023-01-04 00:00:00 | Electronics |       184.17 |
    |    4 | 2023-01-05 00:00:00 | Food        |        27.89 |

    </div>

## 2. Grouping and Aggregation

The second section will cover grouping and aggregation techniques. These operations are essential for summarizing data and extracting insights from large datasets.

=== "Pandas"

    In Pandas, we can use the [`.agg()`][pandas-agg] method to perform aggregation operations on DataFrames. This method allows us to apply multiple aggregation functions to different columns in a single operation.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Basic aggregation"}
    sales_stats_pd: pd.DataFrame = df_sales_pd.agg(

It is also possible to group the data by a specific column and then apply aggregation functions to summarize the data by group.

=== "Pandas"

    This is done using the [`.groupby()`][pandas-groupby] method to group data by one or more columns and then apply aggregation functions to summarize the data, followed by the [`.agg()`][pandas-groupby-agg] method.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Group by category and aggregate"}
    category_sales_pd: pd.DataFrame = df_sales_pd.groupby("category").agg(
        {
            "sales_amount": ["sum", "mean", "count"],
            "quantity": "sum",
        }
    )
    print(f"Category Sales Summary: {len(category_sales_pd)}")
    print(category_sales_pd)
    print(category_sales_pd.to_markdown())
    ```

We can rename the columns for clarity by simply assigning new names.

=== "Pandas"

    In Pandas, we use the [`.columns`][pandas-columns] attribute of the DataFrame. This makes it easier to understand the results of the aggregation.

    It's also possible to rename columns using the [`.rename()`][pandas-rename] method, which allows for more flexibility in renaming specific columns from within 'dot-method' chains.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Rename columns for clarity"}
    category_sales_renamed_pd: pd.DataFrame = category_sales_pd.copy()
    category_sales_renamed_pd.columns = [
        "Total Sales",
        "Average Sales",
        "Transaction Count",
        "Total Quantity",
    ]
    print(f"Renamed Category Sales Summary: {len(category_sales_renamed_pd)}")
    print(category_sales_renamed_pd.head(5))
    print(category_sales_renamed_pd.head(5).to_markdown())
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ```txt

Having aggregated the data, we can now visualize the results using [Plotly][plotly]. This allows us to create interactive visualizations that can help us better understand the data. The simplest way to do this is to use the [Plotly Express][plotly-express] module, which provides a high-level interface for creating visualizations. Here, we have utilised the [`px.bar()`][plotly-bar] function to create a bar chart of the total sales by category.

=== "Pandas"

    The Plotly [`px.bar()`][plotly-bar] function is able to receive a Pandas DataFrame directly, making it easy to create visualizations from the aggregated data. However, what we first need to do is to convert the index labels in to a column, so that we can use it as the x-axis in the bar chart. We do this with the [`.reset_index()`][pandas-reset_index] method.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Plot the results"}
    fig: go.Figure = px.bar(
        data_frame=category_sales_renamed_pd.reset_index(),
        x="category",
        y="Total Sales",
        title="Total Sales by Category",
        text="Transaction Count",
        labels={"Total Sales": "Total Sales ($)", "category": "Product Category"},
    )
    fig.write_html("images/pt2_total_sales_by_category_pd.html", include_plotlyjs="cdn", full_html=True)
    fig.show()
    ```

## 3. Joining

The third section will demonstrate how to join DataFrames to combine data from different sources. This is a common operation in data analysis, allowing us to enrich our data with additional information.

Here, we will join the `sales` DataFrame with the `product` DataFrame to get additional information about the products sold.

=== "Pandas"

    In Pandas, we can use the [`pd.merge()`][pandas-merge] method to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. In this case, we will join the `sales` table with the `product` table on the `product_id` column.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Join sales with product data"}
    sales_with_product_pd: pd.DataFrame = pd.merge(
        left=df_sales_pd,
        right=df_product_pd[["product_id", "product_name", "price"]],
        on="product_id",
        how="left",
    )
    print(f"Sales with Product Information: {len(sales_with_product_pd)}")
    print(sales_with_product_pd.head(5))
    print(sales_with_product_pd.head(5).to_markdown())
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ```txt

    ```

    |    4 | 2023-01-05 00:00:00 |          61 |         45 | Food        |        27.89 |        9 | Product 45   | 493.14 |

    </div>

In the next step, we will join the resulting DataFrame with the `customer` DataFrame to get customer information for each sale. This allows us to create a complete view of the sales data, including product and customer details.

=== "Pandas"

    This process is similar to the previous step, but now we will extend the `sales_with_product` DataFrame to join it with the `customer` DataFrame on the `customer_id` column. This will give us a complete view of the sales data, including product and customer details.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Join with customer information to get a complete view"}
    complete_sales_pd: pd.DataFrame = pd.merge(
        sales_with_product_pd,
        df_customer_pd[["customer_id", "customer_name", "city", "state"]],
        on="customer_id",
        how="left",
    )
    print(f"Complete Sales Data with Customer Information: {len(complete_sales_pd)}")
    print(complete_sales_pd.head(5))
    print(complete_sales_pd.head(5).to_markdown())
    ```

Once we have the complete sales data, we can calculate the revenue for each sale by multiplying the price and quantity (columns from different tables). We can also compare this calculated revenue with the sales amount to identify any discrepancies.

=== "Pandas"

    In Pandas, we can calculate the revenue for each sale by multiplying the `price` and `quantity` columns. We can then compare this calculated revenue with the `sales_amount` column to identify any discrepancies.

    Notice here that the syntax for Pandas uses the `DataFrame` object directly, and we can access the columns using the 'slice' (`[]`) operator.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Calculate revenue and compare with sales amount"}
    complete_sales_pd["calculated_revenue"] = complete_sales_pd["price"] * complete_sales_pd["quantity"]
    complete_sales_pd["price_difference"] = complete_sales_pd["sales_amount"] - complete_sales_pd["calculated_revenue"]
    print(f"Complete Sales Data with Calculated Revenue and Price Difference: {len(complete_sales_pd)}")
    print(complete_sales_pd[["sales_amount", "price", "quantity", "calculated_revenue", "price_difference"]].head(5))
    print(
        complete_sales_pd[["sales_amount", "price", "quantity", "calculated_revenue", "price_difference"]]
        .head(5)
        .to_markdown()
    )

## 4. Window Functions

Window functions are a powerful feature in Pandas that allow us to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. This is particularly useful for time series data, where we may want to calculate rolling averages, cumulative sums, or other metrics based on previous or subsequent rows.

To understand more about the nuances of the window functions, check out some of these guides:

- [Analyzing data with window functions][analysing-window-functions]
- [SQL Window Functions Visualized][visualising-window-functions]

In this section, we will demonstrate how to use window functions to analyze sales data over time. We will start by converting the `date` column to a datetime type, which is necessary for time-based calculations. We will then group the data by date and calculate the total sales for each day.

The first thing that we will do is to group the sales data by date and calculate the total sales for each day. This will give us a daily summary of sales, which we can then use to analyze trends over time.

=== "Pandas"

    In Pandas, we can use the [`.groupby()`][pandas-groupby] method to group the data by the `date` column, followed by the [`.agg()`][pandas-groupby-agg] method to calculate the total sales for each day. This will then set us up for further time-based calculations in the following steps

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Time-based window function"}
    df_sales_pd["date"] = pd.to_datetime(df_sales_pd["date"])  # Ensure correct date type
    daily_sales_pd: pd.DataFrame = (
        df_sales_pd.groupby(df_sales_pd["date"].dt.date)
        .agg(total_sales=("sales_amount", "sum"))
        .reset_index()
        .sort_values("date")
    )
    print(f"Daily Sales Summary: {len(daily_sales_pd)}")
    print(daily_sales_pd.head(5))
    print(daily_sales_pd.head(5).to_markdown())
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ```txt
    Daily Sales Summary: 100
    ```

    ```txt
             date  total_sales
    0  2023-01-01        490.76
    1  2023-01-02        453.94
    2  2023-01-03        994.51
    3  2023-01-04        184.17
    4  2023-01-05         27.89
    ```

    |      | date       | total_sales |
    | ---: | :--------- | ----------: |
    |    0 | 2023-01-01 |      490.76 |
    |    1 | 2023-01-02 |      453.94 |
    |    2 | 2023-01-03 |      994.51 |
    |    3 | 2023-01-04 |      184.17 |
    |    4 | 2023-01-05 |       27.89 |

    </div>

Next, we will calculate the lag and lead values for the sales amount. This allows us to compare the current day's sales with the previous and next days' sales.

=== "Pandas"

    In Pandas, we can calculate the lag and lead values for the sales amount by using the [`.shift()`][pandas-shift] method. This method shifts the values in a column by a specified number of periods, allowing us to create lag and lead columns.

    Note that the [`.shift()`][pandas-shift] method simply shifts the values in the column by a number of rows up or down, so we can use it to create lag and lead columns. This function itself does not need to be ordered because it assumes that the DataFrame is already ordered. However, if you want it to be ordered, you can use the [`.sort_values()`][pandas-sort_values] method before applying [`.shift()`][pandas-shift].

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Calculate lag and lead"}
    daily_sales_pd["previous_day_sales"] = daily_sales_pd["total_sales"].shift(1)
    daily_sales_pd["next_day_sales"] = daily_sales_pd["total_sales"].shift(-1)
    print(f"Daily Sales with Lag and Lead: {len(daily_sales_pd)}")
    print(daily_sales_pd.head(5))
    print(daily_sales_pd.head(5).to_markdown())
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ```txt
    Daily Sales with Lag and Lead: 100
    ```

    ```txt
             date  total_sales  previous_day_sales  next_day_sales
    0  2023-01-01       490.76                 NaN          453.94
    1  2023-01-02       453.94              490.76          994.51
    2  2023-01-03       994.51              453.94          184.17
    3  2023-01-04       184.17              994.51           27.89
    4  2023-01-05        27.89              184.17          498.95
    ```

    |      | date       | total_sales | previous_day_sales | next_day_sales |
    | ---: | :--------- | ----------: | -----------------: | -------------: |
    |    0 | 2023-01-01 |      490.76 |                nan |         453.94 |
    |    1 | 2023-01-02 |      453.94 |             490.76 |         994.51 |
    |    2 | 2023-01-03 |      994.51 |             453.94 |         184.17 |
    |    3 | 2023-01-04 |      184.17 |             994.51 |          27.89 |
    |    4 | 2023-01-05 |       27.89 |             184.17 |         498.95 |

    </div>

Now, we can calculate the day-over-day change in sales. This is done by subtracting the previous day's sales from the current day's sales. Then secondly, we can calculate the percentage change in sales using the formula:

```txt
((current_day_sales - previous_day_sales) / previous_day_sales) * 100
```

=== "Pandas"

    In Pandas, we can calculate the day-over-day change in sales by subtracting the `previous_day_sales` column from the `total_sales` column. This is a fairly straight-forward calculation.

    We can also calculate the percentage change in sales using the [`.pct_change()`][pandas-pct_change] method, which calculates the percentage change between the current and previous values. Under the hood, this method calculates the fractional change using the formula:

    ```txt
    ((value_current_row - value_previous_row) / value_previous_row)
    ```

    So therefore we need to multiply the result by `100`.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Calculate day-over-day change"}
    daily_sales_pd["day_over_day_change"] = daily_sales_pd["total_sales"] - daily_sales_pd["previous_day_sales"]
    daily_sales_pd["pct_change"] = daily_sales_pd["total_sales"].pct_change() * 100
    print(f"Daily Sales with Day-over-Day Change: {len(daily_sales_pd)}")
    print(daily_sales_pd.head(5))
    print(daily_sales_pd.head(5).to_markdown())
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ```txt
    Daily Sales with Day-over-Day Change: 100
    ```

    ```txt
             date  total_sales  previous_day_sales  next_day_sales  day_over_day_change  day_over_day_change  7d_moving_avg

Next, we will calculate the rolling average of sales over a 7-day window. Rolling averages (aka moving averages) are useful for smoothing out short-term fluctuations and highlighting longer-term trends in the data. This is particularly useful in time series analysis, where we want to understand the underlying trend in the data without being overly influenced by short-term variations. It is also a very common technique used in financial analysis to analyze stock prices, sales data, and other time series data.

=== "Pandas"

    In Pandas, we can calculate the 7-day moving average of sales using the [`.rolling()`][pandas-rolling] method. This method allows us to specify a window size (in this case, `window=7` which is 7 days) and calculate the mean over that window. The `min_periods` parameter ensures that we get a value even if there are fewer than 7 days of data available at the start of the series. Finally, the [`.mean()`][pandas-rolling-mean] method calculates the average over the specified window.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Calculate 7-day moving average"}
    daily_sales_pd["7d_moving_avg"] = daily_sales_pd["total_sales"].rolling(window=7, min_periods=1).mean()
    print(f"Daily Sales with 7-Day Moving Average: {len(daily_sales_pd)}")
    print(daily_sales_pd.head(5))
    print(daily_sales_pd.head(5).to_markdown())
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    |    3 | 2023-01-04 |      184.17 |             994.51 |          27.89 |             -810.34 |   -81.4813 |       530.845 |
    |    4 | 2023-01-05 |       27.89 |             184.17 |         498.95 |             -156.28 |   -84.8564 |       430.254 |

    </div>

Finally, we can visualize the daily sales data along with the 7-day moving average using Plotly. This allows us to see the trends in sales over time and how the moving average smooths out the fluctuations in daily sales.

For this, we will again utilise [Plotly][plotly] to create an interactive line chart that displays both the daily sales and the 7-day moving average. The chart will have the date on the x-axis and the sales amount on the y-axis, with two lines representing the daily sales and the moving average.

The graph will be [instantiated][python-class-instantiation] using the [`go.Figure()`][plotly-figure] class, and using the [`.add_trace()`][plotly-add-traces] method we will add two traces to the figure: one for the daily sales and one for the 7-day moving average. The [`go.Scatter()`][plotly-scatter] class is used to create the line traces, by defining `mode="lines"` to display the data as a line chart.

Finally, we will use the [`.update_layout()`][plotly-update_layout] method to set the titles for the chart, and the position of the legend.

=== "Pandas"

    Plotly is easily able to handle Pandas DataFrames, so we can directly parse the columns from the DataFrame to create the traces for the daily sales and the 7-day moving average.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Plot results"}
    fig: go.Figure = (
        go.Figure()
        .add_trace(
            go.Scatter(
                x=daily_sales_pd["date"],
                y=daily_sales_pd["total_sales"],
                mode="lines",
                name="Daily Sales",
            )
        )
        .add_trace(
            go.Scatter(
                x=daily_sales_pd["date"],
                y=daily_sales_pd["7d_moving_avg"],
                mode="lines",
                name="7-Day Moving Average",
                line_width=3,
            ),
        )
        .update_layout(
            title="Daily Sales with 7-Day Moving Average",
            xaxis_title="Date",
            yaxis_title="Sales Amount ($)",
            legend_orientation="h",
            legend_yanchor="bottom",
            legend_y=1,
        )
    )
    fig.write_html("images/pt4_daily_sales_with_7d_avg_pd.html", include_plotlyjs="cdn", full_html=True)
    fig.show()
    ```

## 5. Ranking and Partitioning

The fifth section will demonstrate how to rank and partition data. This is useful for identifying top performers, such as the highest spending customers or the most popular products.

=== "Pandas"

    In Pandas, we can use the [`.rank()`][pandas-rank] method to rank values in a DataFrame. This method allows us to specify the ranking method (e.g., dense, average, min, max) and whether to rank in ascending or descending order.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Rank customers by total spending"}
    customer_spending_pd: pd.DataFrame = df_sales_pd.groupby("customer_id").agg(total_spending=("sales_amount", "sum"))
    customer_spending_pd["rank"] = customer_spending_pd["total_spending"].rank(method="dense", ascending=False)
    customer_spending_pd: pd.DataFrame = customer_spending_pd.sort_values("rank").reset_index()
    print(f"Customer Spending Summary: {len(customer_spending_pd)}")
    print(customer_spending_pd.head(5))
    print(customer_spending_pd.head(5).to_markdown())
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ```txt
    Customer Spending Summary: 61
    ```

    ```txt
       customer_id  total_spending  rank
    0           15         2297.55   1.0
    1            4         2237.49   2.0
    2           62         2177.35   3.0
    3           60         2086.09   4.0
    4           21         2016.95   5.0
    ```

    |      | customer_id | total_spending | rank |
    | ---: | ----------: | -------------: | ---: |
    |    0 |          15 |        2297.55 |    1 |
    |    1 |           4 |        2237.49 |    2 |
    |    2 |          62 |        2177.35 |    3 |
    |    3 |          60 |        2086.09 |    4 |
    |    4 |          21 |        2016.95 |    5 |

    </div>

Next, we will rank products based on the quantity sold, partitioned by the product category. This will help us identify the most popular products within each category.

=== "Pandas"

    In Pandas it is first necessary to group the sales data by `category` and `product_id`, then aggregate the data for the [`.sum()`][pandas-groupby-sum] of the `quantity` to find the `total_quantity` sold for each product. After that, we can use the [`.rank()`][pandas-rank] method to rank the products within each category based on the total quantity sold.

    It is important to note here that we are implementing the [`.rank()`][pandas-rank] method from within an [`.assign()`][pandas-assign] method. This is a common pattern in Pandas to create new columns on a DataFrame based on other columns already existing on the DataFrame, while keeping the DataFrame immutable. Here, we are using the [`.groupby()`][pandas-groupby] method to group the DataFrame by `category`, and then applying the [`.rank()`][pandas-rank] method to the `total_quantity` column within each category. In this way, we are creating a partitioned DataFrame that ranks products by quantity sold within each category.

    ```py {.pandas linenums="1" title="Rank products by quantity sold, by category"}
    product_popularity_pd: pd.DataFrame = (
        df_sales_pd.groupby(["category", "product_id"])
        .agg(
            total_quantity=("quantity", "sum"),
        )
        .reset_index()
        .assign(
            rank=lambda x: x.groupby("category")["total_quantity"].rank(method="dense", ascending=False),
        )
        .sort_values(["rank", "category"])
        .reset_index(drop=True)
    )
    print(f"Product Popularity Summary: {len(product_popularity_pd)}")
    print(product_popularity_pd.head(10))
    print(product_popularity_pd.head(10).to_markdown())
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ```txt
    Product Popularity Summary: 78
    ```

    ```txt
