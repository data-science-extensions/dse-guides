    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Working as a Data Scientist or Data Engineer often involves querying data from various sources. There are many tools and libraries available to perform these tasks, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Also, there are many different ways to achieve similar results, depending on the tool or library used. It's important to be familiar with these different methods to choose the best one for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to query data using different tools and libraries, including Pandas, SQL, PySpark, and Polars. Each section will cover the setup, data creation, and various querying techniques such as filtering, grouping, joining, window functions, ranking, and sorting. The output will be identical across all tools, but the transformations will be implemented using the specific syntax and features of each library. Therefore allowing you to compare the different approaches and understand the nuances of each method."

    "## Overview of the Different Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the querying techniques, let's take a moment to understand the different libraries and tools we will be using in this article. Each library has its own strengths and weaknesses, and understanding these can help you choose the right tool for your specific use case.\n",

    "### PySpark\n",
    "\n",
    "[PySpark] is the Python API for Apache Spark, a distributed computing framework that allows for large-scale data processing. PySpark provides a high-level interface for working with Spark, making it easier to write distributed data processing applications in Python. It is particularly well-suited for big data processing and analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "PySpark provides a DataFrame API similar to Pandas, but it is designed to work with large datasets that do not fit into memory. It allows for distributed data processing across a cluster of machines, making it suitable for big data applications. PySpark supports various data sources, including [HDFS], [S3], [ADLS], and [JDBC], and provides powerful features for filtering, grouping, joining, and aggregating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While PySpark is a powerful tool for big data processing, it can be more complex to set up and use compared to Pandas. It requires a Spark cluster and may have a steeper learning curve for those unfamiliar with distributed computing concepts. However, it is an excellent choice for processing large datasets and performing complex data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start querying data, we need to set up our environment. This includes importing the necessary libraries, creating sample data, and defining constants that will be used throughout the article. The following sections will guide you through this setup process. The code for this article is also available on GitHub: [querying-data][querying-data].\n",

However, we currently have our data is oriented by _column_, where the dictionarieshave keys as column names and values as lists of data.

We can then use the `F.lag()` and `F.lead()` functions to calculate the lag and lead values _over_ a given window on the table.\n",
    "2. **The Spark SQL API**: The Spark SQL API is used through the [`F.expr()`][pyspark-expr] function, which allows us to write SQL-like expressions for the calculations. This is similar to how we would write SQL queries, but it is executed within the PySpark context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here in the below example, we show how the previous day sales can be calculated using the [`.lag()`][pyspark-lag] function in the PySpark API, and the next day sales can be calculated using the [`LEAD()`][sparksql-lead] function in the Spark SQL API. Functionally, both of these two methods achieve the same result, but aesthetically they use slightly different syntax. It is primarily a matter of preference which one you choose to use."
