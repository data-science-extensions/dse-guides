    "Working as a Data Scientist or Data Engineer often involves querying data from various sources. There are many tools and libraries available to perform these tasks, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Also, there are many different ways to achieve similar results, depending on the tool or library used. It's important to be familiar with these different methods to choose the best one for your specific use case.\n",

    "## Overview of the Different Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the querying techniques, let's take a moment to understand the different libraries and tools we will be using in this article. Each library has its own strengths and weaknesses, and understanding these can help you choose the right tool for your specific use case.\n",

    "### Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas] is a powerful data manipulation library in Python that provides data structures and functions for working with structured data. It is widely used for data analysis and manipulation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, Pandas was one of the first libraries to provide a DataFrame structure, which is similar to a table in a relational database. It allows for easy data manipulation, filtering, grouping, and aggregation. Pandas is built on top of [NumPy][numpy] and provides a high-level interface for working with data. It is particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized datasets and is often used in Data Science and Machine Learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas provides a rich set of functionalities for data manipulation, including filtering, grouping, joining, and window functions. It also integrates well with other libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, making it a popular choice among data scientists and analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Pandas is both powerful and popular, it is important to note that it operates **in-memory**, which means that it may not be suitable for very large datasets that do not fit into memory. In such cases, other libraries like PySpark or Polars may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start querying data, we need to set up our environment. This includes importing the necessary libraries, creating sample data, and defining constants that will be used throughout the article. The following sections will guide you through this setup process. The code for this article is also available on GitHub: [querying-data][querying-data].\n",
